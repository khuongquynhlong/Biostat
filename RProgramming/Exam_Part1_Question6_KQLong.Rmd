## Question 6

Prepare a presentation of 5-10 slides using R markdown about the connection between the usage of seatbelt, the outcome of the accident and the severity of the injury.

- A title slide
- At least one slide with text
- At least one slide with a figure
- At least one slide with text and a figure


## Introduction

### Libraries and `nassCDS` data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmosaic)
library(DAAG)
data(nassCDS)
names(nassCDS)
```

## Slide with text

The `nassCDS` data which is a US data from police-reported car crashes (1997-2002) in which there is a harmful event (people or property). Data are restricted to front-seat occupants, include only a subset of the variables recorded. More information about the dataset can be found using the following link: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/DAAG/versions/1.22/topics/nassCDS. The data is a part of the DAAG R package


## Slide with figure

Distribution of accident outcome over the seatbelt usage.

```{r, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 6, echo = FALSE}
nassCDS %>% mutate(injSeverity = as.factor(injSeverity)) %>%
  na.omit() %>% ggplot() +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(dead, injSeverity), 
                       color = injSeverity, fill = injSeverity),
              alpha = 0.6, show.legend = F) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_text(size = 6),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 6)
  )
```


## Slide with test and figure

```{r, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 4, echo = FALSE}
nassCDS %>% mutate(seatbelt = ifelse(seatbelt == "belted", 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(dead) %>% summarise(prop = mean(seatbelt)*100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dead, y = prop)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.3, fill = "skyblue") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(prop, 1), vjust = -0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank())
```

Among people who survived from accident, 72.2% used seatbelt, whereas only 42.4% used seatbelt among those who died from accident.
