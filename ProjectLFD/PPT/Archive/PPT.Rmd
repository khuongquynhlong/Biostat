# Outline

### Introduction

### Results

### Conclusion

---
# Introduction

* Negative effect of smoking on the overall health

* The most affected organ of the body is the lungs

* Negative effect of parental smoking on pulmonary function and lung growth in children 

* Main objective : The effect of smoking on the FEV of the children aged 3 to 19 years

* Secondary objective : The effect of parental smoking on the FEV of the children



---
# Methodology

* **Study design**
  - Cross-sectional subset of a longitudinal observational survey
  - Among East Boston area families (USA)
  - One child per family
  - Total of 654 children

* **Variables of Interest**
  - Outcome : FEV
  - Exposures : smoke and parent smoke
  - Confounders :
  - Main objective : age, gender, sport activity, mother education, and household SES
  - Secondary objective : age, mother education, and household SES


---
# Methodology

* **Set of confounders were selected based on the Directed Acyclic Graphs**
  - Causal relationships
  - Confounding paths between exposure and outcome
  - Unbiased estimates

# Directed Acyclic Graphs

---
# Methodology

* **Descriptive Statistics**
  + Categorical variables : frequency analysis
  + Continuous variables
      - Normally distributed : means (standard deviations - SD) 
      - Skewed distributed : medians (interquartile range – IQR)
  + Marginal normal distribution control : histograms 
  + Summarized by smoking type and total

* **Percentage of missing values**
* **Typos and unrealistic values**


---
# Methodology


* **Modeling**
  + Multiple linear regressions
      - Continuous response variables
      - No control needed for differences
      - Only two categories of exposure variables
      - More than one independent variables
  + 95% confidence interval
  + p-values
  + two-sided hypotheses
  + t-statistics

# Methodology

**Main Objective Models**

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1i}+\beta_{2}x_{2i}+\beta_{3}x_{3i}+\beta_{4}x_{4i}+\beta_{5}x_{5i}+\beta_{6}x_{6i} +\varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1i}+\beta_{2}x_{2i}+\beta_{3}x_{3i}+\beta_{4}x_{4i}+\beta_{5}x_{5i}+\beta_{6}x_{6i} + \beta_{7}x_{1i}x_{3i} +\varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation}

$x_{1i}$: smoking status, $x_{2i}$: age, $x_{3i}$: gender,  $x_{4i}$:sport activities, $x_{5i}$:mother's education, $x_{6i}$: household SES.

**Secondary Objective Model**

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1i}+\beta_{2}x_{2i}+\beta_{3}x_{3i}+\beta_{4}x_{4i} +\varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation}

$x_{1i}$: parent smoking, $x_{2i}$: age, $x_{3i}$: mother education,  $x_{4i}$: household SES

# Methodology

* **Modeling Diagnostic**
  + Normality assumption of error terms : normal probability plots (Q-Q plot)
  + Constancy of error variance : scatter plot of the square root of standardized residuals and fitted values
  + Linearity : residual versus regressors plot
  + Outliers : residual plot
  + Multicollinearity : Generalized Variance Inflation Factor
      - $GVIF^{(1/(2∗DF))}$ criterion
