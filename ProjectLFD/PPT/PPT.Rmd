# Introduction

* Active and passive smoking have potential effects on pulmonary function and lung growth in children 

* Main objective : The effect of smoking on the FEV of the children aged 3 to 19 years

* Secondary objective : The effect of parental smoking on the FEV of the children

# Methods

# Methods

* **Study Design**
  - Cross-sectional subset of a longitudinal observational survey
  - Among East Boston area families (USA)
  - One child per family
  - Sample size: 639 (proposed 654) children

* **Variables of Interest**
  + Outcome : FEV
  + Exposures : smoke and parental smoke
  + Confounders :
      - Main objective : age, gender, sport activity, mother education, and SES
      - Secondary objective : age, mother education, and SES


---
# Methods

* **Set of confounders were selected based on the Directed Acyclic Graphs**
  - Causal relationships
  - Confounding paths between exposure and outcome
  - Unbiased estimates

# Directed Acyclic Graphs

---
# Methods

* **Descriptive Statistics**
  + Categorical variables : frequency and percentage
  + Continuous variables
      - Normally distributed : means (standard deviations - SD) 
      - Skewed distributed : medians (interquartile range – IQR)
  + Marginal normal distribution: histograms 
  + Summarized by smoking type and overall

* **Percentage of missing values**
  + Complete case method to deal with missing values
* **Typos and unrealistic values**


---
# Methods


* **Modeling**
  + Multiple linear regressions
  + parameter estimate and 95% confidence interval
  + two-sided hypotheses
  + t-statistics
  + p-values
  + Significance level of 5%

# Methods

**Main Objective Models**

$$Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1i}+\beta_{2}x_{2i}+\beta_{3}x_{3i}+\beta_{4}x_{4i}+\beta_{5}x_{5i}+\beta_{6}x_{6i} +\varepsilon_{i}$$

$$Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1i}+\beta_{2}x_{2i}+\beta_{3}x_{3i}+\beta_{4}x_{4i}+\beta_{5}x_{5i}+\beta_{6}x_{6i} + \color{red}{\beta_{7}x_{1i}x_{3i}} +\varepsilon_{i}$$

$x_{1i}$: smoking status, $x_{2i}$: age, $x_{3i}$: gender,  $x_{4i}$: sport activities, $x_{5i}$: mother's education, $x_{6i}$: household SES.

**Secondary Objective Model**

$$Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1i}+\beta_{2}x_{2i}+\beta_{3}x_{3i}+\beta_{4}x_{4i} +\varepsilon_{i}$$

$x_{1i}$: parent smoking, $x_{2i}$: age, $x_{3i}$: mother education,  $x_{4i}$: household SES

# Methods

* **Modeling Diagnostic**
  + Normality assumption of error terms : normal probability plots (Q-Q plot)
  + Constancy of error variance : residual versus regressors/fitted plot
  + Linearity : residual versus regressors/fitted plot
  + Outliers : residual plot
  + Multicollinearity : Generalized Variance Inflation Factor
      - $GVIF^{(1/(2∗DF))}$ criterion

# Conclusion

# Conclusion

* The eﬀects of smoking and parental smoking on FEV of children were negligible in this study.

* The gender diﬀerences in responses to smoking also should be further researched

* Limitations
  + One area in the United States
  + Cross-sectional study design
  + Information on levels of smoking and duration of smoking was not collected
